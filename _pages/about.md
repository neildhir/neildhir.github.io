I am research scientist at [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) as well as a visiting researcher at the [Alan Turing Institute](http://www.turing.ac.uk/). Some topics that I find interesting:

- causal inference,
- sequential decision-making under uncertainty,
- Bayesian single/multi-objective optimisation and
- more general experimental design (to mention but a few).

I am particularly interested in those topics under the umbrella of dynamical systems theory.
