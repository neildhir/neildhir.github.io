I am scientist at [Focused Energy](https://www.focused-energy.co). I am also a visiting researcher at the [Alan Turing Institute](http://www.turing.ac.uk/) and a visiting fellow at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/themes/aerospace).

Some topics that I find interesting:

- sequential decision-making under uncertainty,
- causal inference,
- uncertainty quantification,
- surrogate modelling,
- design optimisation and
- experimental design (to mention but a few).

I am particularly interested in these topics under the umbrella of dynamical systems theory.
