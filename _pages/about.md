I am a senior research associate at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Here I am part of the Defence and Security group.

Currently I am interested in causal inference, optimisation,  the sensor scheduling problem, information geometry and more general experimental design (to mention but a few). I am particularly interested in those topics under the umbrella of dynamical systems theory. Under this aegis, I recently completed some postdoctoral work with [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/) on the [London Air Quality project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/london-air-quality), to try to illicit new ideas and understanding in this domain. I also organise [Project Odysseus](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/project-odysseus-understanding-london-busyness-and-exiting-lockdown) - a COVID-19 project.

Before coming to the Alan Turing Institute I, along with others, started a company: [Kamin AI](http://kamin.ai/) in Sweden. Whilst in Sweden I was also working as a research fellow at the University of Liverpool, under the guidance of [Colin Bannard](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/institute-of-life-and-human-sciences/staff/colin-bannard/) and [Tom Stafford](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/tom-stafford), developing NLP-based methods for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. That work recently got [published at CoNLL](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.47.pdf).

*Prior* to all of that (cheeky little Bayesian word-play for you there) I was a DPhil (PhD) student at the University of Oxford, working with [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/), [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/ingmar-posner/) and [Michael Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/). My thesis focused on Bayesian nonparametric methods and their application to powered prosthetics and behaviour-modelling of prides of African lions [(no, really)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6cf7314d-e33d-468b-9bdc-d91ab609c643).
