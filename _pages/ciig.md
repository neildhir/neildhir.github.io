**UPDATE [01/03/2022]:** The CIIG is currently planning new talks, and an email will be sent out in the next few weeks, when all the seminars have been booked in.

The CIIG hosts bi-monthly seminars which discuss recent advances in the field of causal inference, from both empirical and formal perspectives. Everyone with an interest in discussing causal inference is very welcome to come along and we particularly encourage PhD students and research associates.

Our presenters are drawn from both academia and industry. If you would like to present your research (or related causal inference material) at the CIIG, please contact the organisers.

For more information see the main [ATI website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/causal-inference).

## Practical details

* **Where?** Always online but sometimes also in-person at the Alan Turing Institute, London, UK (but will then be streamed as well).
* **When?** Twice a month. Times and dates may vary. The most up-to-date schedule can be found below.
* **How to stay tuned?** Please subscribe to the [mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=CIIG&A=1).
* **Do you have a calendar which I can subscribe to?** You bet we do! Scroll to the bottom of this page.
