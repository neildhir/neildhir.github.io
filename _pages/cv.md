Before joining Siemens Technology US I was at the Alan Turing Institute (ATI), where I worked for a few years as a principal investigator, where my colleagues and I developed a number of methods for using causal inference and sequential decision-making for cybersecurity applications.

At the ATI I also completed postdoctoral work with [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/) on the [London Air Quality project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/london-air-quality), to try to elicit new ideas and understanding in this domain. I also helped organise [Project Odysseus](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/project-odysseus-understanding-london-busyness-and-exiting-lockdown) - a COVID-19 project.

But 'it' did not start at the ATI so to speak; in 2017 my friends and I started a company: [Kamin AI](http://kamin.ai/) in Sweden. Whilst in Sweden I was also working as a research fellow at the University of Liverpool, under the guidance of [Colin Bannard](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/institute-of-life-and-human-sciences/staff/colin-bannard/) and [Tom Stafford](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/tom-stafford), developing NLP-based methods for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. That work recently got published at [CoNLL](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.47.pdf).

*Prior* to all of that (get it? cheeky little Bayesian word-play for you there) I was a DPhil (PhD) student at the University of Oxford, working with [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/), [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/ingmar-posner/) and [Michael Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/). My thesis focused on Bayesian nonparametric methods and their application to powered prosthetics and behaviour-modelling of prides of African lions ([no, really](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6cf7314d-e33d-468b-9bdc-d91ab609c643)).

And if you really really want to travel back in time to my earliest academic origins, you will have found me plodding away in the aeronautics department at Imperial College London. Perhaps my finest achievement there was convincing the department that we were mature and safe enough to have our own microwave in the common room.
